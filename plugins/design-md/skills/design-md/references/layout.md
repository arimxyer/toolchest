# Layout

Also known as "Layout & Spacing".

This section describes the layout and spacing strategy.

Many design systems follow a grid-based layout. Others, like Liquid Glass, use margins, safe areas, and dynamic padding.

## Example prose

```markdown
## Layout

The layout follows a **Fluid Grid** model for mobile devices and a
**Fixed-Max-Width Grid** for desktop (max 1200px).

A strict 8px spacing scale (with a 4px half-step for micro-adjustments) is used to maintain a consistent rhythm. Components are grouped using "containment" principles, where related items are housed in cards with generous internal padding (24px) to emphasize the soft, approachable nature of the brand.
```

## Design Tokens

The spacing section defines the spacing design tokens. These may include spacing units that are useful for implementing the layout model. For example, a fixed grid layout may have spacing units for column spans, gutters, and margins.

It is a
map\<string, Dimension | number> that maps the spacing scale identifier to a dimension value or a unitless number (e.g., column counts or ratios).

```yaml
spacing:
  base: 16px
  xs: 4px
  sm: 8px
  md: 16px
  lg: 32px
  xl: 64px
  gutter: 24px
  margin: 32px
```
